\title{RFPE of submodels of an \code{\link{lmrobdet}} fit}
\usage{
\method{drop1}{lmrobdet}(object, scope, scale, keep)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{the \code{MM} element (of class \code{\link{lmrob}}) in an object of class \code{\link{lmrobdet}}.}

\item{scope}{a formula giving the terms to be considered for dropping.}

\item{scale}{an optional residual scale estimator. If \code{NULL} the residual
scale estimator that corresponds to the model in \code{object} is used.}

\item{keep}{a character vector of names of components that should be saved for each subset model. 
Only names from the set \code{"coefficients"}, \code{"fitted"} and \code{"residuals"}
are allowed. If \code{keep == TRUE}, the complete set is saved. The default behavior is 
not to keep anything.}
}
\value{
An anova object consisting of the term labels, the degrees of freedom, and Robust Final 
Prediction Errors (RFPE) for each subset model. If \code{keep} is missing, the anova object is 
returned. If \code{keep} is present, a list with components \code{"anova"} and \code{"keep"} is returned. 
In this case, the \code{"keep"} component is a matrix of mode \code{"list"}, with a column for each 
subset model, and a row for each component kept.
}
\description{
This function computes the RFPE for the MM-estimators obtained with \code{\link{lmrobdet}} by dropping each single variable in the model.
